## üí° Learnings & Development Insights

Working on the BookAmour project provided valuable experience in key areas of full-stack development:

1.  **Database Management (Clever Cloud):** A deep understanding was gained in provisioning a managed MySQL database, securing connection credentials (using environment variables like `DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`), and connecting a backend application to a remote database server.
2.  **Continuous Deployment (Render):** The entire process of setting up a deployment pipeline was mastered, ensuring the application successfully connected to the external Clever Cloud database using the correct environment variables.
3.  **Data Modeling & Relational Design:** Designing the database schema to handle tables for `posts`, `usersRegistered`, and `votes` (as seen in phpMyAdmin) provided hands-on experience with relational database concepts and querying.
4.  **Secure Configuration:** Properly separating configuration details from the codebase by utilizing the `.env` file for all secret keys, such as database credentials and `SESSION_SECRET`.
